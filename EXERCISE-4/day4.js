// Get user input using prompt(‚ÄúEnter your age:‚Äù). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to wait for the number of years he neds to turn 18.
// Enter your age: 30
// You are old enough to drive.
// Enter your age:15
// You are left with 3 years to drive.
// const age = prompt("Enter your age");
// if(age >= 18){
//   alert("You are old enough to drive");
// }else {
//   alert(`You are left with ${18 - age} years to drive`)
// }
// Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if ‚Ä¶ else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(‚ÄúEnter your age:‚Äù) to get the age as input.
// Enter your age: 30
// You are 5 years older than me.
// const myAge = 20;
// const yourAge = prompt("Enter your age");
// myAge < yourAge ? alert(`you are ${yourAge - myAge} years older than me`):alert(`I am ${myAge - yourAge} years older than you`);
// If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways
// using if else ternary operator.
  let a = 4
  let b = 7
  a>b?console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`):console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
//   4 is greater than 3

// Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?
// Enter a number: 2
// 2 is an even number

// Enter a number: 9
// 9 is is an odd number.
